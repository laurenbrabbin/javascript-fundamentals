## Testing in JavaScript

## Objectives
1. Initialise a new project directory with npm init.
2. Write and run unit tests with Jest.

## Exercise 1
You will test-drive a function called add which will take two numbers calculate their sum.


1. Write a test case that tests a function which takes two numbers as it's arguement and returns the addition of those two numbers
2. Write a second test case (a second it "block") testing with different numbers â€” perhaps adding 0 and 5.
3. Implement the function add into its file add.js so it satisfies the tests you just wrote. Make sure you've required the function from its file, and imported it in the test file.

## Exercise 2
Using the same process, test-drive the function multiply that calculates the product of two numbers.
