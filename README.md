# JavaScript Fundamentals

In the first module (Phase One), I learnt the basics of Javascript through a series of exercises, either building on previous knowledge or discovering new concepts. Towards the end of the module I built more complex programs such as the shopping-basket program, which allowed me to bring in all the knowledge I had learnt throughout the module. 

In phase 2, I work through challenges designed to help me learn how to use JavaScript in a real application, including unit tests, multiple classes, and external dependencies on packages and remote APIs.

## Learning objectives

* Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
* Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking
  programming.
* Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.
